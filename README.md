# Paper.io-inspired Game

## Overview
This is a 2D multiplayer game inspired by *Paper.io*, built using Pygame. In this game, players move around the screen, leaving a paint trail behind them.
The goal is to capture territory by completing closed loops and avoiding collisions with other players.

## Features
- **Player Movement**: Control your player using the arrow keys or WASD.
- **Trail Creation**: Leave a visible trail as you move around the game area.
- **Area Capture**: Close a loop to capture the area inside it.
- **Collision Detection**: Lose a life or the game if you collide with your own or another player's trail.
- **Multiplayer**: Compete against other players in real-time (future feature).
